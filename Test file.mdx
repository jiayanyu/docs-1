# Quick Start Guide
#### Introduction to working with workbooks, datasources, and dashboards in Equals
With Equals you can connect, analyze, and report on live data from the comfort of your spreadsheet. This guide will walk you through some of Equals' core features - workbooks, datasources, and dashboards - to help you hit the ground running.
## What are Workbooks?
</br>
Equals is a fully-featured spreadsheet, so if you’re coming from Excel or Sheets, you’ll feel right at home in your workbook. You can continue to use the functions, shortcuts and pivot tables you already know.</br> </br>

All your workbooks, including those you've created, those shared by your team, and those that are stored in folders that have been shared with you, can be accessed from the 'Workbooks' page. To find specific workbooks, you can use the workbooks search bar or simply apply filters by creator and last updated date.

Beyond the spreadsheet fundamentals, Equals enhances your experience with features designed to turbocharge your analysis. You can debug formulas in seconds with Explain Formulas, use Smartfill to suggest formulas that work in the context of your spreadsheet, and use AI Assist to edit queries, formulas and charts. At any point, you can hit CMD K to open the global search bar and search for any command.
